# Bioinformatics &amp; Cheminformatics Project

This project demonstrates the use of **Python** and **RDKit** for drug discovery-related data analysis.  
It involves collecting molecular datasets from **ChEMBL**, cleaning and curating them, applying filters like **Lipinski‚Äôs Rule of Five**, performing **disruptor calculations**, and generating visual plots.
